# Modeling Lifecycle with ACME Occupancy Detection and Cloudera

Daaata science is more than just modeling. The complete data science lifecycle also includes data
engineering and model deployment. This project offers a simplified yet credible example of 
all three elements, as implemented using [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org), the
[Cloudera Data Science Workbench](https://www.cloudera.com/products/data-science-and-engineering/data-science-workbench.html),
and [JPMML / OpenScoring](https://github.com/openscoring/openscoring).

In this project, the ACME corporation is productionizing a connected-house platform. Part of this
service requires predicting the occupancy of a room given sensor readings.

This example project includes simplified examples of:

- Data Engineering
  - Ingest
  - Cleaning
- Data Science
  - Modeling
  - Tuning and evaluation
- Model Serving
  - Model management
  - Testing
  - REST API

## Requirements

- [Cloudera Data Science Workbench 1.0](https://www.cloudera.com/products/data-science-and-engineering/data-science-workbench.html)
- CDH 5.10+ cluster
- [Spark 2.1 CSD](https://www.cloudera.com/downloads/spark2/2-1.html) for CDH
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org) 3.2+

## Get Started

To continue, review documentation for each of the three modules, which contains more information
about what it show and how to run it.
